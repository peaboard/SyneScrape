 was a Spanish attack on  villages in  and  by a Spanish army in 1759
 The Spanish were defeated by the Taovaya and other  tribes with assistance from the 
The  was established in April 1757 near the site of present day 
 Three miles away, a military post, , was established at the same time to protect the Mission
 The purpose of the Mission was to convert and pacify the  and extend Spanish influence into the 
 The Spanish also wished to check the increase in French influence among the Indians on their northern frontier
The establishment of the Mission inflamed the Indians of northern Texas, called "Norteños" by the Spanish
 The Norteños included the nomadic 
 the village-dwelling Wichita tribes, (the , Iscani, and Wichita proper), and  tribes
 On March 16, 1758, an Indian army, described as numbering 2,000 men, destroyed the San Saba Mission, killing two  priests and several Christian Indian assistants
 The nearby Presidio, staffed by fewer than 100 soldiers, was too weak to attempt to protect the Mission
 Raids continued near the Presidio
 In December, Comanche killed 21 Apache and, in March 1759, another 18 men guarding the Presidio's horse herd
The Commander of the San Luis Presidio, Diego Ortiz Parrilla, an experienced soldier and Indian fighter, organized a punitive mission against the Norteños, especially the Wichita
 The force he slowly assembled consisted of two cannons, 1,600 horses, mules, and cattle, and 636 men: 139 Spanish soldiers, 241 militiamen, 134 Apache Indians, 30  Indians, 90 Christian Mission Indians, and two priests
 The soldiers and the Tlaxcalans were armed with muskets and swords; the Indians mostly with 
 In August 1759, this unwieldy and mostly untrained force set forth northward from 
 Ortiz Parrilla had supplies for a four-month expedition
The Wichita Indians had only recently migrated south from their traditional homeland of Kansas and northern Oklahoma
 Their migration was prompted by pressure from the  expanding onto the Great Plains
 In the early 1750s, the Taovaya, the most important of the several Wichita tribes, had established large twin villages on the north side of  in  and on the south side at 
 The Wichita had trade contacts with the French and in 1746 a French-brokered alliance with the  contributed to their prosperity
 The village at Spanish Fort became “a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco
” The Taovaya villages were the objective of the Spanish army
The Comanche were also migrating south toward the Spanish settlements in Texas and driving the Apache before them
 They were among the first North American Indians to acquire the horse from the Spanish and to create the nomadic, equestrian culture that would typify the 
 The Comanche were powerful and numerous, although divided into several independent bands
 They were in the process of establishing suzerainty over a large area of the southern Great Plains with allies such as the Wichita
The Tonkawa consisted of a number of independent tribes that spoke similar languages
 They lived in central and northern Texas
 Other Indians identified as participating in Norteño raids were , Tejas (), and 
 The various tribes making up the people the Spanish called Norteños were united only in that they shared a common enemy, the Apache, and a concern that a Spanish-Apache alliance would be detrimental to their interests
The first problem of the Spanish expedition was finding the Norteños
 On October 2, Ortiz Parrilla found a Yojuane village, probably along the Clear Fork of the  near present day 
 Attacking the village, the Spanish killed 49 Yojuanes and captured 149
 Some of the captive Yojuanes offered to guide Ortiz Parilla north to a large Taovaya and Iscani village
On October 7, about 60 or 70 Indians Indians attacked the Spanish
 The Spanish formed up in line of battle and dispersed the small Indian force, pursuing them through the woods to the banks of a river, undoubtedly the Red
 The Spanish were surprised to find there a moated fort flying a French flag
 Inside the palisaded wall were the distinctive bee-hive shaped houses of the Wichita
 The inhabitants of houses outside the palisade fled to the fort for shelter
 Upstream were large fields of maize, pumpkins, beans, and watermelons
 Downstream was a ford across the river, guarded by Indian warriors
 The Spanish could also see Comanche  scattered around the periphery of the village
Spanish estimates of the numbers of the Indians they faced ranged up to 6,000, of whom 500 were mounted, although Ortiz Parrilla estimated only that the Indians numbered at least as many as his force of 600
 He deployed the Tlaxcalans and Mission Indians on the right, the Spanish in the center, and the Apache on the left
 His plan was to advance on and storm the fortress, supported by his two cannon
 Indians, however, menaced his flanks, and sallied from the fort in repeated assaults on the Spanish lines
 Each warrior on horseback had two men on foot supporting him, each carrying two additional loaded muskets
 Indian scouts reported that 14 Frenchmen were inside the fortress helping direct the fighting
The battle lasted four hours
 The Spanish were unable to approach the palisaded village
 The eleven volleys of cannon fire they directed at the palisade were ineffective
 The fighting ceased at nightfall and the Spanish reassessed their situation
 The Indians had captured their two cannons, 19 men in the Spanish army, mostly Spaniards, were dead and 14 were wounded
 A number of men had deserted
 The priests and officers petitioned Ortiz Parrilla to abandon the fight
 Next morning, he ordered a return to San Saba which the Spanish force and their Yojuane captives reached on October 25
 The Spanish estimated that they had killed 100 Indians in the battle, probably a large over-estimation
The Yojuane captives were sold into slavery and the group soon disappeared from history, the survivors being absorbed by the Tonkawa
 Neither the Spanish nor the Norteños followed up the battle with any serious military action
 The Wichita tribes later sought peace with the Spanish and refrained from further raids
 In 1767, the Spanish abandoned the San Saba mission and their efforts to Christianize the Apache
 The Spanish peace with the Apache soon broke down and Apache and Comanche raiders continued to be a serious threat on the northern frontier of Spanish settlements
It is uncertain whether the battle took place on the Texas or the Oklahoma side of the Red River
 The traces of the village remaining on the Oklahoma side of the border are now called the Longest archaeological site
